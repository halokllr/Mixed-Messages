# **Mixed-Messages**
Codecademy Mixed Messages Project

<br></br>
# **Codecademy Overview**
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## **Project Objectives**
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

## **Prerequisites**
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

# **Tasks**
- ## __Create the message__
    - Add functionality to randomly select the different message components so they can create a cohesive message.

- ## __Come Up with a Topic__
    - Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

- ## __Create script and run it locally__
    - On your computer, create a JaaScript file to write your code in.  Make sure you are able to run your script locaaly in Node.

- ## __Set up version control__
    - Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.

- ## __Put the program together__
    - Combine the different parts of your program so the random messages are selected, combined, and then displayed to the user each time they run the program.

- ## __Next Steps__
    - You're welcome to expand your program beyond these proect tasks and get creative!

- ## __Store messsage components__
    - Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.
